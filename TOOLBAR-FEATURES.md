- **History navigation:** Step forward/backward through changes
- **Clear support:** Clearing the canvas is treated as an undoable action
- **Independent histories:** Student and teacher have separate undo stacks

### Drawing State Management
```javascript
// Each stroke stores:
{
    color: '#dc2626',      // Selected color
    tool: 'pen',           // pen or eraser
    size: 4,               // Brush size
    points: [{x, y}, ...]  // Path coordinates
}
```

### Real-time Sync
- Teacher's color/tool/size sent to student in real-time
- Student sees annotations with correct colors
- Eraser works correctly on both sides
- All toolbar changes reflected instantly

### Palm Rejection
- **Stylus mode ON:** `pointerType === 'pen'` filter
- Ignores touch and mouse when stylus mode enabled
- Allows all input types when disabled
- Perfect for iPad/tablet use
