# Live Drawing Tool

A real-time collaborative drawing app where students can draw and teachers can provide instant visual feedback through annotations.

---

## üéØ What It Does

**Students** draw on a canvas using their stylus or mouse.

**Teachers** view all students' work in real-time and can annotate directly on their drawings to provide feedback.

**Everything syncs instantly** - no delays, no refresh needed.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Supabase Setup

The student and teacher pages ship with the live classroom project's Supabase
credentials inlined for convenience. If you need to use your own project,
update the small `<script>` block near the top of both
`student-supabase.html` and `teacher-supabase.html` with your project's URL and
anon key.

### 2. Run the Server

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:3000

### 3. Open the App

- **Landing Page:** http://localhost:3000/min/
- **Student:** http://localhost:3000/min/student-supabase.html
- **Teacher:** http://localhost:3000/min/teacher-supabase.html

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**"Student not appearing on teacher side"**
- Check session codes match
- Wait 5-10 seconds for connection
- Check browser console for errors

**"Eraser not working"**
- Switch to Pen tool then back to Eraser
- Make sure you're dragging across strokes
- Eraser radius is 30px minimum

**"Work disappeared after refresh"**
- Only works if you logged in with same username
- Session storage is per-user per-browser
- If you cleared browser data, work is lost
