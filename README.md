- **Backend:** Supabase Realtime (broadcast channels)
- **Storage:** SessionStorage (browser-local, temporary)
- **Rendering:** HTML5 Canvas

### Data Flow
```
Student draws ‚Üí Store locally ‚Üí Broadcast to Supabase
                                    ‚Üì
Teacher receives ‚Üê Subscribe to Supabase ‚Üê Store in memory
```

### Coordinate System
- Base canvas: 800√ó600 (logical pixels)
- Display canvas: Responsive (scales to fit)
- Strokes stored in base coordinates
- Scaled for display using CSS

### History System
- Immutable stroke array
- History pointer (`historyStep`)
- Undo = move pointer backward
- Redo = move pointer forward
- Erase actions stored as objects with deleted IDs

## üì¶ Deployment

### Static Hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel)

1. **Hardcode Supabase credentials** in the HTML files:
   ```javascript
   const SUPABASE_URL = 'your_url_here';
   const SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = 'your_key_here';
   ```

2. **Remove** the `/config.js` dependency

3. **Upload** these files:
   - `index.html`
   - `student-supabase.html`
   - `teacher-supabase.html`

4. **Done!** Your app is live.

### With Node Server (Heroku, Railway, Render)

1. Keep `.env` file with Supabase credentials
2. Deploy the entire project
3. Server will serve from `/public` directory
4. `/config.js` endpoint provides credentials securely

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**"Student not appearing on teacher side"**

- Make sure you're dragging across strokes
- Eraser radius is 30px minimum

**"Work disappeared after refresh"**
- Only works if you logged in with same username
